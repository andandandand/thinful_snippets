For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. 
Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.

Q:The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months. 
A:Regression, as amount spent can range from 0 to some potentially very large obersavble max. Continuous variable looking for realtionship
between variables. 

Q:What color car someone is going to buy.
A: Classification since car color as a classifer would assing a category to a given test observation

Q:How many children a family will have.
A:Could be either. For classification you can rank the liklehood of each value of children, 
but with regression you can find the most liekly place along a continuous line.

Q:If someone will sign up for a service.
A: Classification, as this would take discrete value, like {yes,no}. 

Q:The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
A: Could be either but I would model regression, 
because the value could range form zero to potentially large (uper bound of 365) and icould find the outcome on a continuous line.

Q:The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
A: Classification, as you can discretely label the variable, as {will get sick, will not get sick}, and the variable can 
assign a probablity of each category (prob of getting sick). 

Q:Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
A: Classification - discretely labeled and probabilities can be assigned .
