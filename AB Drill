Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
  For this experiment, I am going to assume that sleeping better does not necessarily mean longer sleep,
  but rather assist with uninterrupted sleep (and secondarily assist with falling asleep faster). 
  - Two Versions: Two groups of people, a control group that takes a placebo and a test group that takes the supplement. 
  
  - A Sample: I would want to sample from a population of people with reported sleep problems
   (similar problems, like waking up a lot during the night). I also need to ensurethat my sample is randomely distributed 
   evenly between the two versions, and that each group is similar in age, gender, and lifestyle habits (i.e poor sleep is not 
   a result of habits that impede sleep like excessive drinking).

  - A Hypothesis: The test group that takes the supplement will experience better (uninterrupted) sleep. 

  - Outcomes of Interest: As I want to avoid self reported responses, I would want to measure sleep quality through 
   a sleep monitoring app available on smart phones. For those that do not have a smart phone, 
   they would be provided with a temporary device.The phone goes under the pillow and measures when someone is asleep. 
   I would want to measure sleep over a span of 2-3 weeks. 
   My key metric would be the number of times that someone wakes up during their sleep. 
   My hypothesis will be supported if the test group wakes up less, on average, than the control group. 

  - Other measured variables: I would want to also measure the duration of sleep, how long it takes someone to fall asleep, 
   and if someone wakes up, the length of time before they fall back asleep. 

Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
  For this experiment, I will assume that the gym has two locations, geographically close together, 
  so that the makeup of the members are likely similar between the two gyms. 
  I would measure these during a typical, non-peak, gym season, such as the Fall or Spring. 

  - Two Versions: Gym A employees would wear the new uniforms and Gym B employees would wear casual wear. 
  
  - A Sample: My sample would be prospective members of the gyms. Ideally I would want to measure this over a time span of 1-2 months. 
  To make it easy to control for timing, I would introduce open informational sessions for people to come in to find out more about the membership. 
  These would take place at the same time, at each gym, ideally daily. 
  This would help (but not fully) randomize the sample between the gyms as they can choose between 
  either location (both of which are close together). 
  
  - A Hypothesis: New Uniforms will help increase gym membership signups.  

  - Outcomes of Interest: My key metric would be new gym memberships. 

  - Other measured variables: While it might be hard to infer that people signed up purely due to the uniforms, 
  I can survey the members that signed up to ask what factors influenced their decision, with an option being professional appearance. 
  I can also monitor retention for the members that signed up at each location over the duration of the experiment.
  
Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
  - Two Versions: Group A would be a random sample sent to the old site, and group B would be a random sample sent to the new version. 
  
  - A Sample: Assuming the extoic pet rental business is very niche (and likely to attract similar groups of users) 
    my sample would be a random sample of visitors to the site, limited to a certain time frame each day. 
  
  - A Hypothesis: Visitors that are shown the new version of the site are more likely to rent an exotic pet. 

  - Outcomes of Interest: My key metric would be pet rentals.

  - Other measured variables: I might also want to track (if able to), bounce rate, page views, and time spent before placing a rental. 
  These will also help me understand if the new version presents a better user experience overall. 

If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
  - Two Versions: Version A would have the please read in the subject line and Version B does not. 
  
  - A Sample: Assuming I send a lot of emails (to have a large enough sample), my sample would be a group of randomely selected 
  email recipients. I would want to make sure that each group is similar in age, gender, and that each group 
  had received a similar number of emails from me prior to the experiment. 
  
  - A Hypothesis: Recipients that receive the Please Read email are more likely to read it. 
  
  - Outcomes of Interest: My key metric would be the number of read receipts I receive. 

  - Other measured variables: I would also want to measure the number of responses to my emails.
