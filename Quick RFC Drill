Sith Lord Slogan

The Problem - How does the Sith increase recruitment to the dark side? Overall recruitment is down, as more and more droids 
have turned to the Jedi, and their powerful slogan, 'The Force is in all of us'. Palpatine and Vader have found out through some market 
research that droids respond well to a good slogan, and have already tested two versions with a sample of captured droids. The Death Star 
Scientists informed them that this was not the best approach, given the design and other inferent flaws. 

Potential Solution.
