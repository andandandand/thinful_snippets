Sith Lord Slogan

The Problem - How does the Sith increase recruitment to the dark side? Overall recruitment is down, as more and more droids 
have turned to the Jedi, and their powerful slogan, 'The Force is in all of us'. Palpatine and Vader have found out through some market 
research that droids respond well to a good slogan, and have already tested two versions with a sample of captured droids--
"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy" and "Give in to your anger", the latter of which was more successful in gaining recruits.
The Death Star Scientists informed them that their design was flawed for a variety of reasons. For one, each slogan was delivered by 
a different observer. Also, captured droids are probably going to be angry as it is, so the 'Anger' slogan is likely to appeal to
their current mindset. 


Potential Solution - Using the "Together we can rule the galaxy" slogan will increase droid recruitment by 20% more than 
the "Give in to your anger" slogan through appealing to their desire to become a part of something bigger, something important. 

The Method of testing the solution: A sample of droids from across the galaxy (not limited to captured droids) is taken
every month for 4 months, consisting of 100 droids each month. Palpatine and Vader will each present one of the 2 slogan to a
group of 50 droids each session. The next month, they will switch off the slogans they present, once again presenting to a group of 50 
droids each. This continues for 4 months. If recruitment for each presenter, for each slogan, is not siginificantly different, 
we can reasonably assume that the person who presents does not impact recruitment. If the recruitment for droids presented the Together 
slogan is 20% higher than that of the Anger slogan, I can confidently conclude that the former slogan is more effective.
