Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. 
We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?

I could use KNN to find similarities in credit card holder payment behavior, based on the spend of the 4 categories and classify them 
baed on their likelihood to pay on time. 

There are things I would need to do in order to run this: 

Normalize- Since the spend of the 4 categories likely have different bounds and ranges, I could either: 
  1. set bounds to 0 and 1, and recale every variables witin those bounds. I would first want to look to see if these variables have 
  a linnear relationship with my outcome variable, to understand whether scaling to a 0 and 1 range makes sense.
