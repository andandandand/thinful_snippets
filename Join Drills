----1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
SELECT	
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration,
	DATE(t.start_date) trip_date
FROM
	trips t
JOIN 
	weather w
ON
	trip_date=w.date
WHERE w.Events ='Rain'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT 3

---2.Which station is empty most often?
SELECT 
	stat.station_id,
	station.name, 
	COUNT(CASE WHEN stat.docks_available = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) empty_docks
FROM status stat
JOIN stations station
ON
	stat.station_id=station.station_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC

--3.Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT 
	t.start_station, 
	s.dockcount,
	COUNT(*)
FROM 
	stations s
JOIN 
	trips t
ON 
	s.name=t.start_station
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
SELECT 
	r.trip_date trip_date,
	max(r.duration) max_duration
FROM 
	(SELECT 
		t.trip_id,
		t.duration,
		DATE(t.start_date) trip_date
	FROM 
		trips t
	JOIN 
		weather w
	ON
		trip_date = w.Date
	WHERE 
		w.Events= 'Rain') r
GROUP BY  1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
