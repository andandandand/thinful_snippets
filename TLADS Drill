Categorize each of the variables in the ESS dataset as categorical or continuous, 
and if continuous as ordinal, interval, or ratio variables. 
Check your work with your mentor, and discuss what that information might imply for feature engineering with this data.

cntry: categorical

idno:continuous (ordinal) - does ordering of ID numbers mean something? time of which user joined. if not, likely categorical. probably useless
tvtot: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
ppltrst: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
pplfair: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
pplhlp: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
happy: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
sclmeet: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
sclact: continuous (ordinal) could be modeled as categorical
gndr: categorical
