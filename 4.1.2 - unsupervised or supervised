1.Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease
Supervised, as we have an outcome that we are attempting to predict, which the likelihood of contracting a disease. 


2.Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
Unsupervised as we don't have any particular outcome we are trying to predict/learn about. 
Unsupervised models can help uncover the latent variables, which are impactful but not explicitly defined in the initial dataset.


3.An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
Supervised if there is a definition of what constitutes a power user. If so, we can use supervised models to predict whether 
a user is a power user or not. If this is not defined unsupervised models would help idenitfy patterns, or cluster in users, which can 
then be used to interepret which cluster would constiute power users. 


4.That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
Unsupervised - there is not outcome, but rather we are explicitly looking for patterns which unsupervised tehcniques can uncover. 



5.You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
Could be both. PCA, an unupervised technique will help reduce the number of variables. However, there are supervised techniques
that are good at reducing the number of features (feature importance, lasso, ridge, etc.)
